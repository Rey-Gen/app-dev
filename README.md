# Breaking Bad

**Its an American criminal drama television series created and produced by Vince Gilligan for AMC.**
* The reason this show is so great is that there are just too many negative aspects. It has a number of drawbacks, including excessive wealth, drug use, and drama. Things go from normal when someone is overly greedy for money. While the main character in the show was initially identified as a high school chemistry teacher, it was later determined that she had cancer. He turned to making illegal drugs as a result of his disease. He finally rose to the top of the illegal drug trade by being exceptionally skilled at it. He lost the most important things in his life and made too much money. *

>“Who are you talking to right now? Who is it you think you see? Do you know how much I make a year? I mean, even if I told you, you wouldn’t believe it. Do you know what would happen if I suddenly decided to stop going to work? A business big enough that it could be listed on the NASDAQ goes belly up. Disappears! It ceases to exist without me. No, you clearly don’t know who you’re talking to, so let me clue you in. I am not in danger, Skyler. I am the danger. A guy opens his door and gets shot, and you think that of me? No. I am the one who knocks!”
